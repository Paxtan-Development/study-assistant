An app that help students to monitor their notes and projects.

## Installation
The apk files can be found at the [releases](https://github.com/Paxtan-Development/study-assistant/releases) page.

If you wish to compile the apk yourself, you can compile it directly from the [source code](https://github.com/Paxtan-Development/study-assistant/releases).
However, do publish the app under a different package name (Not com.pcchin.studyassistant) to avoid any conflict with this app.

If you wish to compile in a version other than debug, you would need to set up the following environment variables for keystores under a `keystore.properties` file in the root directory of the project:
- `keystoreDir`: The file containing your keystore.
- `keystoreAlias`: The alias for your keystore.
- `keystorePass`: The password to access your keystore.
